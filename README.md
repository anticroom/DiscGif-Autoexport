# DiscGif-Autoexport
A simple python script which gets all your discord tokens that are valid on ALL your clients to then runs an API request with each token to get the gifs.

Gif extracting forked from [eepyfemboi](https://github.com/eepyfemboi/discord-favorite-gifs-exporter) but now made to automate easily :)
